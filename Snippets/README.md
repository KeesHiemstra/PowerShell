# Snippets

Windows PowerShell ISE can add snippets (Ctrl-J).

The most used snippet for me is `Cmdlet (advanced function) - complete`, but is not complete and has some odd layout. My snippit `Advanced function` is correction in my view.

You can create a temporarly snippet with the CmdLet `New-ISESnippet`.

Store the file in default snippet folder `$home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Snippets` and is available when Windows PowerShell ISE is 
started. Copy the file to the snippet-folder, start ISE and the new/updated snippet is available.
