#Snippets

Windows PowerShell ISE can add snippets (Ctrl-J).

The most used snippet for me is "Cmdlet (advanced function) - complete", but is not complete and some odd layout.

You can create a temporarly snippet with the CmdLet New-ISESnippet.

Store the file in default snippet folder ($home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Snippets) and is available when Windows PowerShell ISE is 
started.
